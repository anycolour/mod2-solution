  		<div class="title" id="1">Maurice Ravel</div>
  		<p>As a slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas, and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or religious works. Many of his works exist in two versions: a first, piano score and a later orchestration.</p>

  		<div class="title" id="2">Claude Debussy</div>
  		<p>Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. The prominent French literary style of his period was known as Symbolism, and this movement directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as a significant active cultural participant.</p>

  	<div class="block row2">
  		<div class="title" id="3">Erik Satie</div>
  		<p>In addition to his body of music, Satie was "a thinker with a gift of eloquence" who left a remarkable set of writings, having contributed work for a range of publications, from the dadaist 391 to the Vanity Fair. In later life he prided himself on publishing his work under his own name, but in the late 19th century he appears to have used pseudonyms such as Virginie Lebeau.</p>
